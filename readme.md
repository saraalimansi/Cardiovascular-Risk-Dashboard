# Cardiovascular Risk Report ðŸ«€ 

## Project Overview  
This Power BI report provides a comprehensive analysis of patient data to assess **cardiovascular risk factors**. The project involves **data cleaning, transformation, creating DAX measures, and designing interactive dashboards** to deliver meaningful insights.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI** â€“ Data visualization & reporting  
- **Power Query** â€“ Data cleaning & transformation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** â€“ Creating calculated measures  

## Report Structure  
The report is divided into **three main pages**, each focusing on a different aspect of the analysis:  

 **Cardiovascular Risk Overview** â€“ High-level KPIs and risk assessment.  
 **Patient Details & Lifestyle Analysis** â€“ Analyzing individual patient data and lifestyle factors.  
 **In-Depth Data Analysis & Case Tracking** â€“ Detailed exploration and case monitoring.  

## Data Cleaning Process  
- Identified and handled **missing values** by replacing them with calculated averages.  
- Removed **duplicates** and ensured data consistency.  
- Detected **outliers**, such as negative or extremely high blood pressure values (>10,000), and replaced them with appropriate values.  
- Transformed numerical data into **meaningful categories** for better analysis.  




## ðŸŒŸ About the Project  
This project was an exciting journey, from **data collection and cleaning** to **visualizing insights** effectively. It highlights the power of **Power BI** in healthcare analytics and how structured data can reveal crucial patterns.  

ðŸš€ Excited to explore more **data-driven solutions**!
